# HAM STACK
## HTMX, Astro, MongoDB

I wanted to make something with HTMX, so I looked it up. I found AHAstack, and I switched some things out for Mongo. So, HTMX, Astro, and Mongodb.

I found that Astro is really good at this sort of thing and HTMX makes it slick as heck. I added Google oauth2 with auth-astro because I saw it was being PR'd on Auth.js. It was pretty simple actually!

There's not much to it, you can sign in and blog. Swapping elements with HTMX and server rendering makes it pretty slick overall

I'll probably use this for my next similar project
